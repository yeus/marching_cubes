# marching_cubes
easy to understand marching cubes implementation in python

This is the repository for the code published on blender artists some time ago:
https://blenderartists.org/t/generation-of-isosurfaces-skript-marching-cubes/550928/13

meanwhile there are two more implementations which are based on this code:
* https://github.com/Pyroevil/CubeSurfer  #cython version, used in a blender addon
* https://github.com/mutantbob/blender-marching-cubes  #numpy version
